\section{Introduction}

New York City (NYC) would like to implement a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AV) by 2020 as part of a larger initiative of establishing itself as a world leader in smart city infrastructure. In such context, city officials wish to understand which alternatives they should consider and how they should proceed in terms of strategies in regards to AV technology within the NYC fleet of vehicles. This study will focus on the alternatives available to implement an automatic merging system (from AutoMerge, Inc.) specifically in NYC's 40-passenger transit buses. It will compare different alternative strategies using Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA). Among the factors to be included in the analysis are: safety, energy consumption, GHG emissions, weather conditions and traffic flow.
